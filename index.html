                        <br>
                        Inspired by <i>dlmalloc</i>, the standard dynamic memory allocator used in the standard
                        GNU library. <i>dlmalloc</i> is a very good example of how a simplistic idea can be generalized
                        to many applications. The main idea of <i>dlmalloc</i> is the Segregated Free List, which
                        is used to achieve high performance - amortized O(1) allocation and free - while maintaining
                        low fragmentation and high peak memory utilization.
                        <br>
                        This allocator is optimized for specific workloads using various techniques such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Preallocation (a technique extensively used in <i>dlmalloc</i>)</li>
                            <li>Deferred free</li>
                            <li>On-demand coalescing of free neighbor blocks</li>
                        </ul>

                            Designed to aide users to find their way around facitilies with complex layouts - e.g. Costco,
                            Walmart, malls. Using their browsers, users are able to construct a 2D layout which matches
                            that of the concerning facility. Users are able to place rectangles, which represent stores/locations,
                            and also paths to indicate path/walkways which connect the stores/locations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the layout design scheme seems very simplistic, most interior layouts can be represented
                            simply with rectangles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After the layout has been inputted, the user then inputs a list of destinations which he/she
                            would like to visit within this facility, and, with the layout provided, the application will
                            do its best to compute the shortest possible distance which visits all destinations.

                            <strong>Shortest Path & Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)</strong>
                            <br>
                            Naturally, shortest path is implemented using <i>Dijkstra's Algorithm</i>. We decided to approach TSP by: (1)
                            Performing the <i>Nearest Neighbor</i> algorithm to find an initial solution; (2) To
                            improve upon the initial solution, a global minimum can be closely approximated by
                            using <i>Simulated Annealing (SA)</i>, which iteratively and randomly performs local improvement
                            using the <i>2-Opt</i> algorithm until improvements can no longer be made.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To benchmark performance of <i>2-opt</i> and <i>SA</i> implementations, an approximated <i>Held-Karp</i>
                            algorithm (which yields a lower-bound distance on the optimal TSP solution) was implemented.
                            The algorithm was implemented using the top-down dynamic programming approach.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>2-Opt: 10-15% improvement over Nearest Neighbor</li>
                            <li>SA: 20-30% improvement over 2-Opt</li>
                            <li>SA within 5% of Held-Karp Lower Bound</li>

                            This is my first attempt at using OpenGL to render 3D graphics. OpenGL is a difficult
                            library to learn from the onset, and this was a consistent challenge.
                            Here is a list of features currently present:
                            <ul>
                                <li>.OBJ file processing</li>
                                <li>Per-fragment Blinn-Phong Shading</li>
                                <li>2D Textures</li>
                                <li>Shadow Maps - FBOs and 3D Textures</li>
                            </ul>

                        <p>
                            As this project is ongoing, I hope to expand to include:

                            <i>MapReduce</i> is a Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) distributed processing
                            framework developed by Google. Its advantages are providing a framework which leverages
                            Google's massive compute infrastructure to enable the processing of massive workloads (in
                            the order of terabytes) across thousands of machines while guaranteeing reliability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project is an imitation of <i>MapReduce</i>. It first implements a distributed
                            Key-Value storage system, which is replicated at least 3 times, and available up to
                            half of the total number of active nodes in the network. MapReduce, then, is placed atop
                            this reliable, distributed Key-Value store (much like Google's MapReduce is placed atop
                            the Google File System).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Storage servers also serve as MapReduce workers. All communication occurs over reliable
                            TCP channel. Please see the report for implementation details as well as performance
                            testing results.

                            The function of the Circuit Schematic Visualizer is to render each circuit component at
                            predefined positions and orientations. Separate sub-modules
                            were created for each unique component including: resistor, capacitor, dependent/independent
                            voltage & current sources, wires, and ground nodes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The SFG Overlay solves the curve-generation problem by employing a heuristical variation of
                            Bézier curves, a polynomial interpolation technique where a curve is procedurally generated
                            based on a set of predefined control points.

                        I’m Jimmy. I'm a software engineer currently based in Toronto, Canada. I graduated from the University of Toronto in 2020 with a Bachelor's of Applied Science, majoring in Computer Engineering, and have since been working as a Systems Software Developer for the start-up, FutureVault, a document management platform for corporations and institutions.                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My main role at FutureVault is as the primary operator and maintainer of a backend system, which I designed and implemented, that uses SFTP to integrate with 3rd party software to automate the delivery of millions of documents to client accounts. Starting as a Proof-of-Concept for one client 4 years ago to process a few dozen documents, it has since scaled to capture a wide range of use-cases, including: data migration, periodic financial/personal statement delivery, data backup and recovery, and more. To date, across more than a dozen institutional clients, 40% of all documents within FutureVault have been processed through the software I designed and implemented, which has proven to be one of the most successful and robust features in the product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having worked with AWS for over 4 years, from serverless to Kubernetes, I am experienced in using cloud technologies to build scalable applications, and I am intimately familiar with the software development and release lifecycle of a cloud-based product, from design, to implementation, to deployment. As well, I pride myself on my strong communication skills, both verbally and in writing (e.g. documentation, emails).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would describe myself as logical, adaptable, attentive, caring, compassionate, and laid-back. I love sports and staying active! In my free time, I golf, swim, ski/snowboard, travel, and spend time with my family. This year, I'm hoping to participate in my first triathlon, start my own blog, and push myself to trying more things outside of my comfort zone.
                    <p>
